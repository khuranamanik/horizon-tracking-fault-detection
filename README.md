# horizon-tracking-fault-mapping
An Approach to Automated Horizon Tracking and Fault Mapping Using Machine Learning Algorithms”

## Abstract
All the time invested into the actual Fault Mapping and Horizon Tracking can now be considerably reduced with the approach presented in this project. There have been many researchers on the same mission to find something that can help geophysicists and geoscientists make a few of their tasks automated. The application presents an idea of how we can change the “segy” file into a much more human-readable format and use it for our further findings. The whole code is divided into various snippets for a much better comprehension of the entire piece of it. The actual Horizon Tracking will require this modified data to be put into a different module of code that can identify the faults in the Seismic Graphs and modify it accordingly. The code uses some sample data, links to which are provided as well.
